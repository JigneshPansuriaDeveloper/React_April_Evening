//Component

1)Functional component(function)


-> light weight
-> presentation data
-> can handle only props
-> less functionality



2)classbased component (class)
-> heavey in weight because we are creating class
-> memory consumption is more
-> lots of functionality can be handle
-> It supports state and props



function A   	->		function	B
state	Props		state


Difference between state and props
1) Props is used for communicating between two components
1) state is used for same component only


// Lifecycle methods in Class based component

initialization
rendering 
unmounting 

componentwillmount()
componentwillupdate()
compoenentDidMount()
componentDidUpdate();
shouldComponentUpdate()
componentwillUnmount();


// How to create a fake api

step 1: install json server
		npm install -g json-server
Step 2 :json-server --watch db.json --port 8900



======================= Redux ===================
Redux is nothing but the state management library

Redux works on this three principles

Redux follows unidirectional flow

1) Single source of truth ->global state in your app
2) state is read only or unmutatable(not change)
2)  changes are made with pure functions(reducer)

Reducer has two things -> state,	

Redux is isolated means it can use with any framework like angular,vue,React or vanila JS


React redux has two methods
1)mapDispatchToProps
2) mapStateToProps


Node ->redux => installation steps

1) npm init
2) npm install redux


React redux
1) install basic react app
2) install redux react-redux



// Middleware

-- when we dispatch any action it directly update in redux store
so if api failure happens then it will represent wrong data in dom so to achive failure case
we have to use middleware.

Middlewae is nothing but the function which we create once wrapper before sending /dispatch
to redux store.


Type of Middlewae
1)Thunk middleware
2) Saga middleware

1) Thunk middles -
install -> npm install redux-thunk

npm redux react-redux redux-thunk
