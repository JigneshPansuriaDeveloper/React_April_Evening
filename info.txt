//Component

1)Functional component(function)


-> light weight
-> presentation data
-> can handle only props
-> less functionality



2)classbased component (class)
-> heavey in weight because we are creating class
-> memory consumption is more
-> lots of functionality can be handle
-> It supports state and props



function A   	->		function	B
state	Props		state


Difference between state and props
1) Props is used for communicating between two components
1) state is used for same component only
